# chickenpi

An automated chicken coop door.  At the core, it's a Raspberry Pi Zero W interfacing to some Hall Effect sensors and a DC motor for door open and close automation, but for extra functionality has other components and/or sensors for chicken coop monitoring:

- Temperature & Humidity sensors
- Raspberry Pi NoIR Camera
- Light Dependent Resistor
- IR LED light
- Arduino Uno

It is also "connected" to the [Cisco Spark](https://www.ciscospark.com/) platform for monitoring/reporting as well as remote control.
